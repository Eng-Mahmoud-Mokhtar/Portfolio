# portfolio

A personal portfolio website built using Flutter Web, designed to present my professional profile, technical skills, and project experience in a clean and interactive layout. The website provides a smooth user experience with responsive design, subtle animations, and well-organized sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact. It serves as a digital resume and a live demonstration of my frontend development capabilities using Flutter for the web.
